Scraping Tripadvisor restaurants pages collecting e-mail,phone number,name of place and location and puting it in csv file in the end

Hello all
This is my first ever project/scraper and i put a lot of effort in it.
Please do not be rude as i guess most things can be edited and changed.
I accept all constructive comments and advices to improve code
IMPORTANT NOTICE
TripAdvisor does not support being scraped for data and as so use this code at your own risk.
Also long time.sleep() functions are there to allow JS to load and also to not put lots of stress on their website.
I created it as interesting project for my self, you are free to take code and play with it but i do not accept any consequences if they occur.
Have fun and good da
